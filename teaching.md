## Currently

* **Introduction to object-oriented programming, documentation and testing**, *ENSAI*. In this course for first-year students at ENSAI, I teach good programming practices (illustrated in Python). The students learn how to document and test their code. The students also learn the basics of object-oriented programming and UML diagrams.

* **Data processing project**, *ENSAI*. First-year students at ENSAI practice what they learned in the *Introduction to object-oriented programming, documentation and testing* course by working on a data processing project.

* **Deep learning**, *ENSAI*. In this course for third-year students at ENSAI, I teach the basics of deep learning. After an introduction on artificial intelligence, the students learn what an artificial neural network is and how it is trained. Then they learn basic layers and architectures (multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network). Finally they learn more advanced architectures (generative adversarial networks, transformers).
