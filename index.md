I'm currently a PhD student at the
[Brain and Spine Institute](https://icm-institute.org/en/)
in the [Aramis Lab](https://www.aramislab.fr).
I'm working on the prediction of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's
disease and I'm supervised by Olivier Colliot and Jean-Christophe Corvol.
I'm interested in machine learning with medical applications and Python
programming. I love contributing to open source software when I have the time
to.
