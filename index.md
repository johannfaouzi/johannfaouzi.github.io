I'm currently a PhD student at the
[Brain and Spine Institute](https://icm-institute.org/en/)
in the [Aramis Lab](https://www.aramislab.fr).
I'm working on the prediction of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's
disease and I'm supervised by Olivier Colliot and Jean-Christophe Corvol.
I'm interested in machine learning with medical applications and Python
programming. I love contributing to open source software when I have the time
to.


### PhD thesis

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in
the world, with no cure available for the moment. The therapeutic strategy is
based on the dopamine replacement therapy. Although available since the 1960s’,
it is only relatively recently that behavioral disorders associated with these
drugs have been described. Gathered under the term of “behavioral addiction”,
they include impulse control disorders (ICDs), dopamine dysregulation syndrome,
and punding.

The main objective is to build predictive models of ICDs in Parkinson's disease,
in order to improve the quality of life of the patients. These models will
make use of clinical and genetic data as both data types are known to be
associated with ICDs.


### Open source software

I strive for open science and open source software in particular.
I find creating and contributing to open source software to be a great
learning experience.
